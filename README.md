# k-means

## Overview

* Implementation of Kmeans clustering algorithm using public Iris Dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/).

## Features
* The implementation of the algorithms are in only academic purpose
* The base programming language used is [C++](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++")

## Demonstration

The implementation shows the belonging of every flower into one of the 3 clusters used for this particular dataset. After this, the coordinates of the used centroids are displayed in console as shown below:
